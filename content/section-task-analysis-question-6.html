The users may access to the system via their own device or the commonly shared devices. Hence, for the private environment, the user data should be cached and the users do not need to log in every time. On the other hand, the private data in public environment should be cleared once the users exit from the system.<br>
The system should retrieved the common data (available textbooks, textbook status) from the server dynamically. The data in the client side and the server site should be consistent.
