<a id="design-problem-overview" class="anchor" href="#design-problem-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Problem Overview</h3>

            <p>At the beginning of each semester, almost every NUS student will encounter a problem: purchasing textbooks. However, based on our research, more than 72% of textbooks in Co-op cost more than 40 SGD. Some are even more than 60 SGD. The high prices lead to the birth of IVLE used-textbook market.</p>

            <p>According to our research, there are generally three ways for NUS students to buy or sell their used textbooks. 
            <p>1. 10%:  from friends/senior/juniors</p>
            <p>2. 10%:  via Carousell</p>
            <p>3. 80%:  via IVLE used-textbook forum</p>
            <p>It is obvious that IVLE used textbook forum are the main platform for used textbooks exchanging. </p>

            <p>However, based on our personal experiences and some complaint from classmates, our team find there are a lot of design problems with the forum. These problems include the confusing user interface design, defective functionalities, etc. These problems waste users’ time and bring in awful user experiences. Hence, our team would like to put our effort in the production of a new used textbook exchange platform. </p>

            <br>
            <h3>
<a id="target-user" class="anchor" href="#target-user" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Target Users</h3>
            <div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; padding: 20px 0px 5px 0px"><span>NUS students who need to buy or sell their used textbooks</span></div>
            <p>The aim of our project is to understand the existing design problems of the current IVLE used textbook forum and finally redesign it or produce a new platform. So we choose those students who need to buy or sell their used textbooks, especially for students who prefer to use an online platform to trade as our target users. Therefore, our target users are NUS students, either undergraduate or graduate students, who need to buy or sell secondhand textbooks. </p>
            <p>We have a large group of target users for two reasons. On one hand, since some of the textbooks can be quite expensive, some students, may prefer to buy a used textbooks from other students. On the other hand, some textbooks are only used by one specific module, students may not use them again once they have finished that module. In this case, some students may choose to sell the textbooks to other students. Therefore, these two groups of students may both become our potential users. </p>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <h5>User 1</h5>
            <p>
            Our user1 is a 25-year-old male student from computer science. We conducted the interview at COM1-DR1, during this 38-minutes-interview Mingyu and Yuxuan were the Interviewers while Fanshi and Jinghan were the note takers. This user raised a very good point that we haven’t noticed before: when users click the button to insert an audio file, the forum will pop up a window to ask users to install a software called Silverlight. Our user thought the pop up window was very annoying and almost no one would actually choose to install the software. Besides, our user1 thought inserting an audio file is not really a useful feature. Based on this experience, we would like to cancel some seldom used features also avoid things like pop up window which may annoy the users. Last but not least, the server response was very slow during the interview, it took about 1 to 2 minutes to access a page. We think the server problem is also very serious.
            </p>
            <h5>User 2</h5>
            <p>
            Our user2 is a 21-year-old male student from computer science. We conducted the interview at COM1-DR1. During this 28-minutes-interview Fanshi and Jinghan were the Interviewers while Mingyu and Yuxuan were the note takers. Our user2 mentioned that there are some textbooks that are not used by any module, resulting in that he doesn’t know how to search for it. Based on this point, we think the new forum needs to be able to search for not only the module code but also the name of the textbook. 
            </p>
            
            <h5>User 3</h5>
            <p>
            Our user3 is a 22-year-old male student from computer science. We conducted the interview at COM1-DR1. During this 32-minutes-interview, Jinghan and Mingyu were the Interviewers while Yuxuan and Fanshi were the note takers. The problem that user3 encountered during the interview is that he cannot quickly come up with what information to put in a post. He mentioned that users could easily forget to put some important informations such as their contact numbers. Therefore, our user3 suggested that we can provide some templates to help users post quickly. We think this is a very good idea. 
            </p>
            
            <h5>User 4</h5>
            <p>
            Our user4 is a 23-year-old female student from Chinese study. We conducted the interview at AS1-02-01. During this 30-minutes-interview, Yuxuan and Fanshi were the Interviewers while Mingyu and Jinghan were the note takers. When user4 tried the system, she thought there was only 10 entries in total. She didn’t notice that it was actually 10 entries per page and she can click the scroll pane to go to next page. Therefore, we decide to increase the number entries and make the navigation buttons more obvious.
