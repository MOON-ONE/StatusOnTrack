<h5>Thread #2: The responsiveness of the whole system is another problem.</h5>
<p>
During the contextual inquiry, a lot of time was wasted on loading the page. The time spent on entering the forum homepage is still fine. However, every time we clicked on each faculty entry to search related textbooks, the loading time was very long. 
<br><br>
On the other hand, waiting for seller’s reply is also a time-consuming process. Users have no idea whether the seller will reply them on the forum or not. We found lot of such examples on the forum: a buyer’s reply under a post, but we found no responses from the seller.
<br><br>
We have collected some user statements for this problem:<br>
“Most of time are wasted in waiting for the page to load.”<br><br><br>
“It’s very time consuming to wait for the sellers’ replies since they may not check IVLE very frequently ”
<br><br>
So there are two problems here, one is the page loading time while another is the feedback time of seller or buyer.
<br><br>
Actually, we were also confused about why the loading time is so long. Hence, we analyzed the forum and found that every time we clicked on the faculty entry, it would load everything under that faculty. For example, in the forum home page, we can see there are more than 2000 posts inside the FASS(Faculty of Arts and Social Science). So these 2000 posts are all loaded to serve the user. That’s why after the page is fully loaded, the search function will return the result almost immediately since everything is already there. 
<br><br>
For the feedback time part, we find that it is because sellers may not frequently check whether there is a reply and also they think reply on the feedback is troublesome. So they will prefer push messages or SMS which they can reply immediately.
<br><br>
From the finding above, we think that to design the new platform, we do not need to load everything when open the platform. We can just display some most recent information. If the user want to find out more, then they just click and load more. And we will also use instant message or hand phone number as our communication method.
