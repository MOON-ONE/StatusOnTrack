<a id="design-problem-overview" class="anchor" href="#design-problem-overview" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Problem Overview</h3>

            <p>At the beginning of each semester, almost every NUS student will encounter a problem: purchasing textbooks. However, based on our research, more than 72% of textbooks in Co-op cost more than 40 SGD. Some are even more than 60 SGD. The high prices lead to the birth of IVLE used-textbook market.</p>

            <p>According to our research, there are generally three ways for NUS students to buy or sell their used textbooks. 
            <p>1. 10%:  from friends/senior/juniors</p>
            <p>2. 10%:  via Carousell</p>
            <p>3. 80%:  via IVLE used-textbook forum</p>
            <p>It is obvious that IVLE used textbook forum are the main platform for used textbooks exchanging. </p>

            <p>However, based on our personal experiences and some complaint from classmates, our team find there are a lot of design problems with the forum. These problems include the confusing user interface design, defective functionalities, etc. These problems waste users’ time and bring in awful user experiences. Hence, our team would like to put our effort in the production of a new used textbook exchange platform. </p>

            <br>
            <h3>
<a id="target-user" class="anchor" href="#target-user" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Target Users</h3>
            <div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold; padding: 20px 0px 5px 0px"><span>NUS students who need to buy or sell their used textbooks</span></div>
            <p>The aim of our project is to understand the existing design problems of the current IVLE used textbook forum and finally redesign it or produce a new platform. So we choose those students who need to buy or sell their used textbooks, especially for students who prefer to use an online platform to trade as our target users. Therefore, our target users are NUS students, either undergraduate or graduate students, who need to buy or sell secondhand textbooks. </p>
            <p>We have a large group of target users for two reasons. On one hand, since some of the textbooks can be quite expensive, some students, may prefer to buy a used textbooks from other students. On the other hand, some textbooks are only used by one specific module, students may not use them again once they have finished that module. In this case, some students may choose to sell the textbooks to other students. Therefore, these two groups of students may both become our potential users. </p>
