Currently in the IVLE Used Textbook Forum, there are with 6004 topics with 6467 posts there. It will be nearly impossible to find the textbook we want without searching. There are two types of searching in the current system: in the faculty page there is a searching bar for searching the marched faculty (which seems useless), and the other one in the posts page. The searching functionality is quite simple and straightforward now, just one search bar and one search button. The user can only search for the title of a post, and it takes a fare amount of time if there are thousands of posts to search. During our contextual inquiry, we asked the user about the most important functionality of a used text book forum, and the responses we collected are more or less the same: searching! For the potential improvement of the system, they also mentioned searching frequently:
<br><br>
<ul>
	<li>
		“10 star app: intuitive, searching function”
	</li>
	<li>
		“The most important feature: searching.”
	</li>
	<li>
		“global search is needed.”
	</li>
	<li>
		“What’s the core function? For buyers, it is search. For sellers, it is connivence of making a new post.”
	</li>
</ul>
<br>
They also complained about the current searching function and the faculty search is considered redundant and confusing.

From the user statements, we can easily find that searching is indeed the soul of a used textbook forum; and the current system is not perfect yet, it might meet the basic needs of the user since the searching at least works. However, it is not powerful enough as there are a number of attribute the user might need to consider when they are finding the textbook, such as availability, condition, edition, prices and maybe the dealing location. On the other hand, users are not satisfied with the current performance of the system, they surely prefer the fast search that can immediately give them results.
<br><br>
Our insights from the users are: searching function should be accessible and obvious; and it must support searching for different property of the textbook (this could be done in the advanced search mode, in case some of the users just want the basic search function). It also need to be efficient enough that can generate the results in a short time.
