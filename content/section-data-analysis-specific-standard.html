During the contextual inquiry, sometimes when we asked the interviewee to create a new post to sell a book, they would spend much time on thinking what are the information to put on the post. Things like module code, name and the price the textbook are easy to think of. However, they may easily forget to put the condition of the book and their contacts. For example one of our interviewee said “I cannot find the contact of the seller. It seems that he/she forget to leave one.” Therefore they think if we provide some standard format for posting it would be very useful and save users a lot of time to think what to put.

Besides, some of our interviewees also mentioned that 
    <ul>
        <li>“it is hard to tell what is the exact condition of the textbook when seeing the condition like 8/10 and 9/10”.</li>
    </ul>
    They think a standard, or explanation is needed so that buyers can know what exactly the seller thinks of the textbook condition. Though some users may think people’s understanding of the condition of a textbook may still vary with people, but we believe having explanation is better than only having the numbers.

To conclude, the format problem can be divided into 2 main problems: One is to provide post templates for sellers to choose so that they can post quickly without forgetting to provide some useful information. Another one is to specify the condition levels to help users know better the exact condition of the textbook.

From the above discussion, we think we should provide a template with module code, name of the textbook, edition, condition, price and the contacts and some other important information listed. Moreover, we think template for both title and contents are necessary. Also, we may need to provide a brief explanation of each condition level for both buyers and sellers to refer to.
