As soon as the interviews were over, the audio records and field notes were gathered together and settled according to the four interviewees we got. The thing we went through is to refine these field notes/sketches: write all the points down on memopads, labelled them in a consistant format and then finally organized them in 14 different categories (in total 101 items).
