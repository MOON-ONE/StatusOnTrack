            <!-- problem -->
            <h4>Problems</h4>
            <p>The overall problems we want to solve is actually the three key tasks, namely, search, post and comparison. We want to improve the user experience on theses three key tasks to help them to finish the tasks better and wasier. Furthermore, we also have some additional problems which we want to tackle. Solving these problems may not help the user in finishing the key tasks. However, it produce other benefits like save the user time, etc. These problems can be generally categorized into 2 types, the overall user interface, the responsiveness of the whole system and also attachments.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Search</h5>
            <p>
                Previously, the search function is not obvious. User have to look around to find out the search bar. It is because the search bar is not in a outstanding position and the size of it is too small. 
                <br>
                <br>
                And the function of the search bar is quite confusing and not useful. For example, in the home page, it can only search the result within the same page. There is no a powerful global search, either. The user has to go into different faculty page to search the specific books. They cannot directly just use a global search to find out what they want. 
                <br>
                <br>
                At the same time, the search algorithm also has problems. The results after searching are listed randomly. Moreover, it is not clear whether the result is listed because its title contains the keyword or the description inside the post contains the keyword. It may make user confused if there is no keyword in the title but inside the post. They may think the search function give them a wrong result. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Post</h5>
            <p>
                The post page before has a lot of UI problems. Most of the users complain that there are too many useless buttons inside the post box, especially for audio attachment function. They have no idea why we need an audio attachment for selling or buying used textbooks. With so many buttons, the whole post looks very messy.
                <br>
                <br>
                The post box do not have a guideline on what need to be filled in, as well. It’s just a simple message box. There is no a standard way for the posting. So two posts may have a totally different layout, which may make the user feel confused and spend lots of time on finding the necessary information. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Comparison</h5>
            <p>
                In the old used textbook forum, no comparison functions are provided. It is because there is no a standard format on the input. So data like price is not stored on a comparable base. As a result, the difference between two posts are not intuitive. So it may become difficult for a user to decide from two different selling information. 
                <br>
                <br>
                hand, comparison should also allow users to select some interested posts and compare them. It is quite common that in current forum, there are many posts on the same book. However, users may be on interested in some of them. So if a system allows them to choose and display the interested posts,  it will be a great help
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Overall user interface</h5>
            <p>
                The whole design for the forum is not attractive. Everything inside the forum has an IVLE design style which is not that colorful and impressive. Especially, user2 mentioned that he may not want to use the old style forum if there is a newer and nicer one. And those important information has not been highlighted.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>The responsiveness of the whole system </h5>
            <p>
                In almost every interview, when we want to click on each faculty entry to search related textbooks, the loading time was very long. Furthermore, the time for search function to produce a result is very long. 
            </p>
            <!-- problem end -->
            <!-- solutions -->
            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <p>To solve the problems as mentioned above, we do a lot of user research and finally come out with some solutions.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Search</h5>
            <p>
                On the design part, the overall design of the search bar is very neat and clear. We put the search bar on top of the page and make the search bar as large as possible in order to make it be more outstanding. We also add some descriptions inside the search bar to show users what they can key in for searching. 
                <br>
                <br>
                On the function part, we implement powerful search function to the search bar by using angular js. The search function can not only support the global search but also can show the result very fast. Almost when you type in something, the results will change accordingly. To show the result more clearly, we list the search results by module code and post date to solve the previous problem “random listing”.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Post</h5>
            <p>
                To solve the UI problems, we decide to cut a lot of elements which remain in the current IVLE forum. For example, we cut the audio attachment, a lot of buttons and also the post box. In order to guide the user to fill the information, we standardize the input field for every post. So after clicking on the “post” icon, they will be directed to a new page. The necessary information will be listed clearly inside the page. What users need to do is just to fill in the according field, so that they do not need to worry about what information they need to write down. Based on this design, all posts will have same layout. We also implement the attachment function. But this time, we only allow the photo uploading to minimize the design elements.
                <br>
                <br>
                After user clicking on create post, a new post will be automatically generated. A preview page will be shown. The information will be listed out clearly. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Comparison</h5>
            <p>
                Based on our design, users can directly compare the items in the home page now. It is because we standardize the format for every post. Hence, in the home page, you can see those important information like price and book condition are listed within their own column. So it will be very convenient for users to compare different posts. 
                <br>
                <br>
                To make the comparison function more helpful, we also allow the users to select those interested posts. And there will be a button “show selected only” for them to toggle the visibility of unselected ones. As a result, users can directly compare those interested posts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>User interface</h5>
            <p>
                To solve the UI problems, we totally change the overall UI design. We try to design a modern and cool website to make it more attractive. So we use a popular “Flat Design” to make every element look flat. We also use black and white as main color to make it as neat as possible. Why we choose back and white is also because they are cool enough. We also add some nice effects to make the website different. For example, if you click on the hamburger icon on the top left, it will show a push effect to push the whole page to the right. 
                <br>
                <br>
                We also try to minimize our elements to make the whole website simple and neat. Everything you can see on the website is necessary or helpful. You will not find anything redundant. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>The responsiveness of the whole system</h5>
            <p>
                To solve the problem, as mentioned above, we use angular js for result listing. Aagular js allows fast data search and sorting. It has a lot of powerful functions associated with sorting, searching and filtering. By implementing the angular js functions, the result for search can be shown immediately.

            <br>

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
            We basically conduct a formative evaluation on our final interactive prototype. We choose think aloud as our evaluation method. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We have invited totally three users to evaluate our final prototype. Each user will conduct the three key task we have described in G2, namely, search, post and compare. During the process conducting the three tasks, they need to speak out their thoughts/comments upon the final prototype they are interacting with. From the user’s experience, we can refine the statements he or she makes and list all the advantages and disadvantages of the prototype, which leads to our retrospective review and final prototype improvement. Besides, the user may also give us valuable suggestion as he or she is playing around the system. In order to capture all the useful points from the user, we have two members in charge of notes-taking, we also take audio recording of the user in case we miss some of the important points in our side notes. Finally, we will analyze the points we take down, summarize it, and know about where we are successful and where are not.

            <h4>Major findings</h4>
            <h5>Search</h5>
<pre>

1. Search bar should be placed on top of the page. The search button will 
   contain a dropdown list, in which user can specify various search criteria.
   
2. User can select multiple search results, and toggle the visibility of 
   unselected ones.
   
</pre>

            <h5>Compare</h5>
<pre>

1. The column name should be clickable. Once clicked, the system will sort 
   the items according to the value of this column. Keep clicking will reverse 
   the order.
   
2. Smart sorting: ranks are calculated from price and condition.

3. Statistics: average, minimum, maximum price and total number of books (All
   figures are calculated based on current visible result).
   
4. When a seller is filling the book info, relative statistics will be shown. 
   (A background search is performed by the system, and the values shown is 
   calculated based on the search result)
   
</pre>

            <h5>Post</h5>
            <pre>
            
1. In some of our prototypes, the posts have been categorized into “selling 
   wishes” and “buying wishes”. However, base on the evaluation, most of the 
   users will ignore the “buying wishes” section. They tend to use the search 
   functionality to find what they want. Therefore, we decide to remain only 
   selling wishes section. However, in some special cases, the user may not 
   find what they want. In this case, we allow the user to add it to the his/
   her wish list. Later if some one post a qualified book on the forum, the 
   user will be notified (by email, etc.)

2. We find that we may include the following information:
    2.1 Book Specifics
        2.1.1 Module Code (*)
        2.1.2 Book Title (*)
        2.1.3 Author
        2.1.4 Edition
        2.1.5 Condition: Checklist & a figure from 1 to 10
        2.1.6 Photo: upload from desktop or smart phone
    2.2 Contact Specifics
        2.2.1 Phone (*)
        2.2.2 Email
    2.3 Order Specifics
        2.3.1 Price
        2.3.2 Remark
        
3. A preview will be shown for confirmation before the post is actually 
   recorded in the database.
            </pre>

            <h5>Account</h5>
            <p>
                (This is not mentioned in the three key tasks above, but we find that it is closely related to them during the user evaluation. Therefore we put it here as a major finding or a requirement for our G3 high-fidelity prototype.)
            </p>
<pre>

1. User can modified their contacts. (Which will be used to pre-fill 
   corresponding fields when they create a post)

2. User can view their historical posts, renew them or mark them with 
   “Sold out” or “Close”.

</pre>

            <h4>Summary & Reflection</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
            In G2, each of the team member has come up with an low-fidelity prototype. We evaluated each of the prototypes with 4 of our target users. In the process of evaluation, the author of the prototype helped the user to carry on with simulation while the rest of the team record the words and behaviors of the user. It’s a formative evaluation, we will improve our designs with the feedback of current prototypes from the potential users. 
            <br>
            <br>
            During the evaluation process, user will “think aloud” - to tell us how he/she is thinking or feeling and help us to understand more about the experience the system bring to him/her. The overall evaluation result is acceptable: we conclude the pros and cons from different prototype, list them in a form for easy comparison and we finally combine the good features from the 4 individual prototype to construct a single and integrate one.
            <br />
            <br />
            We are glad that we have always kept the two personas we came up with in Step One in our minds. The whole evaluation process is carried out with respects to the three main task from the two persona, namely searching, posting and comparing. We asked every testing user to proceed the three tasks and record their opinions. Nevertheless, we do not restrict them from side-lines: users can always give us whatever feedbacks or comments they want to give.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, there are problems occurring during the evaluation process. The most severe one is that the quality of prototypes is not good enough.  Only very basic low-fi paper prototypes are built to cover the main three task. Although this is the requirements specified inside the project manual and it might be good enough for us to burst some creative ideas, personally I think such low fidelity will bring in very much distraction when we are actually carrying out the evaluation. Most of the users cannot directly understand the meaning for the various components in the prototype. They tend to ask the designer to explain the interface. Without the explanation from the designer, it is very hard for users to find out how the system works. It is because low fidelity and incompleteness of the prototype do not allow them to do the trail & error explorations. However, if the designer explain how the system works, then it seems the purpose of evaluation is violated because during the actual use, designers cannot be aside to every user to guide them through the system. As this stage, personally we think doing an expert evaluation is more appropriate since we can explain the work flow of the system to experts and then they can evaluate the system with the heuristics and their own expertise. Such evaluation is much more insusceptible to the fidelity of prototype than those walkthrough evaluations involving actual users.
