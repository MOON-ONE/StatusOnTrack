In our pre-interview research, we noticed that there was almost no post on the IVLE forum containing any form of multi-media. There were no pictures, no audio messages, only a few lines of blank texts. However, the confusing point is the forum did support to add in such multi-media, but users simply did not want to. Here introduced an interesting fact, and we did pay our attention on this fact during the contextual inquiry. During the CI, unsurprisingly, there was no interviewee showing any interest to involve such media in their post. We paused the interview, and asked the interviewees why they didn’t want to add in pictures or audio messages. The responses were not exactly the same:
    <br><br>
    <ul>
        <li>“I won’t install another browser plugin just for adding an audio message.”</li>
        <li>“I don’t need those audio messages”</li>
        <li>“It’s too troublesome to upload pictures here in the forum.”</li>
        <li>“The display layout of the forum is not optimized for pictures. You see, all images are shown as attachment icons”</li>
        <li>“Everyone will include pictures with Carousell because you can upload it directly from the phone. But with IVLE forum I have to take a picture with my phone, transfer the picture to my laptop, and finally got it uploaded.”</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
From the user statement, we could understand that the attitudes of users toward different multimedia contents are different. Most of our interviewee consider images as a better-to-have content, but they can’t feel the necessity of involving audio messages. Most users don’t need audio messages, therefore, even though we include a convenient audio messages tool in the new design, most users may still leave that out of their post. However, users don’t add pictures is not because they don’t need them, but they have to go through a very complicated procedure to view or upload a picture with the current system. If there is a easy way to upload and view pictures in the post, they would like to try very much.

Here, the design ideas break through: we may leave audio messages our of the first several iterations of design, but we need a simple way for the users to upload their pictures easily. The uploading process should be directly access with mobile devices to avoid the troubles brought by the inter-devices transfer process. Additionally, we need a picture-friendly layout to support easy browsing of all the pictures uploaded.
