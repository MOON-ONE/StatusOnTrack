Briefly, we went through the following post-interview processes:<br>
<pre>
1. refine field notes/sketches, audio recording from the interviews
2. write all outcomes of (1) on memopads
3. arrange and  categorize the memopads to generate the affinity diagram
4. extract key observations from the affinity diagram
5. start from key observation, iterate through the hierarchy of key 
   observations, user statements, breakdown, insights and until we
   get the design ideas.

* During the above process, if we encountered any problems or ambiguities,
we would return to the raw data to confirm the interviewee's meaning
