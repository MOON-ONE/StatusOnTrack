            <p>
                Users prefer more accessible tools such as mobile application. If the platform is integrated in other system, the user should be able to find the entry point easily.
                <br> Elegant user interface will attract the user at the first glance.
                <br> The system should be navigable, user may want to go back the initial place.
                <br> The UI design should conform to a certain convention, otherwise the user might feel confused.
                <br> Currently some of the important functionalities are not very obvious enough; the user may not know what they can do.
                <br> Displaying too many unnecessary elements will decrease the usability of the system.
                <br> System should be responsive and error-free, people will lose their patience when waiting and encountering server error.
                <br> Users tend to check the most recent post first.
                <br> Users expects to get notified when there are updates on their post.
                <br> Users prefer to be guided instead of exploring the system themselves.
                <br> Users may want to compare the available choices with each other.
                <br> Users tend to choose the product whose target user group is more closed to the user.
                <br> Users tend to choose the product with more active users.
                <br> Users tend to choose the product that is more usable.
                <br> Users may want to see their past posts.
                <br> Buy and sell are better to be separated.
                <br> People may want to see the result that they post.
                <br> Redirection should make sense.
                <br> There should not have any irrelevant content.
                <br> Searching in a broader range will reduce the unnecessary work.
                <br> Pictures and images is more attractive than plain text.
                <br> Good categorization will make the system clearer.
                <br> A standard format will make the various content well organized.

                Building a credit system so that users can rate for the sellers and buyers
                <br> Good: The system may help users to identify good sellers and buyers so that they can have high quality deals.
                <br> Bad: This feature has high possibility that becomes a useless feature at the end since many users may not bother to rate after they complete their deals.
                <br>
                <br> Making an app for the forum
                <br> Good: App is more portable and maybe easier for users to use.
                <br> Bad: Implementation and maintenance are quite time consuming.
                <br>
                <br> Having a colorful UI
                <br> Good: The UI will become more attractive and some users may think it’s clearer and easier to use with.
                <br> Bad: The theme will become not consistent with the whole IVLE.
                <br>
                <br> Adding another column to state the price and condition
                <br> Good: Users can see the price and condition quickly. This feature is good for comparing.
                <br> Bad: Providing too much info at the title may make the title become messy.

                        <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Requirement Analysis</h3>

            <p>The features are ordered bases on the number of concerns they raised.</p>

            <br>
            <h5>User Interface</h5>
            <p>Although we conduct interviews on only four target users, surprisingly there are twenty concerns (one fifth) are about the user interface. The word “nice”, “elegant” or “nice-looking” might be too general to conclude the exact design specifics. Therefore, we kept digging down this thread and found that users want the interface to contains the following detailed features: </p>
            <h6>clear</h6>
            <p>The important informations should be clear to users. For example, the prices or titles should be placed carefully so that the user do not have to switch between pages frequently to check these information
            </p>
            <h6>minimized</h6>
            <p>
                only show the core functionalities and necessary details, e.g. show only on-sale items, only commonly used buttons, etc . </p>
            <h6>intuitive</h6>
            <h>icons of the buttons should be reasonable enough to induce what will happen if user click it. Less intuitive icons should be grouped with text that is strong enough to tell the functionalities.</h>
            <h6>consistent</h6>
            <p>although it’s a new design, we still need to try to make it consistent to the existing systems. This will make it much easier for users to accept the new system.</p>
            <h6>self-explaining</h6>
            <p>since user will not bother to read a user guide before using the system, the system has to be self-explaining to some extent. For example, use placeholders to indicator the use of certain textfields, make reasonable titles for pages to help user navigate through the whole system.</p>

            <br>
            <h5>Standards for information format</h5>
            <p>Among the 101 concerns, 10 are on the information format issues. These issues include user input standard and some unified standard about the book condition. Specifically,</p>
            <h6>create templates for user</h6>
            <p>When user want to sell a text book, they should be some post skeletons for users to choose. What they need to do then is just fill in the important figures, such as price, condition, contact, etc. This helps users to recognize information they need to input instead of recalling, thus it lowers the chance that a user miss some important information. These templates should separate the information user input to different sections, each of which has its unique id. This will reserve the space for data manipulations later.</p>
            <h6>A standard for book conditions</h6>
            <p>Sometimes descriptions like 9/10, 8/10 do not give the buyers enough information to know about the exact condition of the book. A standard, which could be measured in figures, is need to act as the ruler of such descriptions.</p>

            <br>
            <h5>Responsiveness</h5>
            <p>7 concerns are on the responsiveness of system. Users are not satisfied with the connections speed of the existing forum. Something that we need to do include</p>
            <h6>Efficient algorithms to load views</h6>
            <p>This might be the main reason why current system operates so slow. We shall keep refine our algorithms to make the system scalable to large user groups.</p>
            <h6>Deploy on faster servers</h6>
            <p>This may be another factor that affects the performance of the website badly. We may want to deploy it on a faster server when it proves that the performance of current ones is the bottleneck of the system.</p>

            <br>
            <h5>Picture Attachments</h5>

            <p>6 concerns are on attaching pictures to the post. User want a convenient way to upload and view images. Some requirements are:</p>

            <h6>Easy Uploading</h6>
            <p>A convenient way to upload pictures. Users need this functionality, but the super troublesome procedure of the currently system keeps them away from this. We need to brainstorm an idea to allow users to upload pictures easily with their smart phone.</p>
            <h6>Easy Viewing</h6>
            <p>Since we will support easy uploading, some posts may get many pictures attached inside. We need a organized way to display such pictures.</p>

            <h5>Search</h5> Interestingly, only 4 concerns are about the searching functionality of the system, but all of our interviewees view searching as the most important functionality of a textbook forum. The requirements brought up by the users are:

            <h6>Global Search</h6>
            <p>There should be a way to search among all the books available on the forum. Although we will have different categories, yet we have to provide a second way in case some sellers put their books in the wrong section.</p>
            <h6>Search for various attributes other than title and module</h6>
            <p>Some users have the need to search for a specific version of a book while others may need to search for authors. We need to extend the current search engine to accept keywords in more domains.</p>
            <h6>Specification of the relationship between keywords.</h6>
            <p>Some users may need only one of the keywords they input is satisfied by the shown results while others may require the results met all the keywords. We need to provide a way for the user to specify which relationship they want. (AND-relationship or OR-relationship) </p>
