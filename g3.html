            <!-- problem -->
            <h4>Problems</h4>
            <p>The overall problems we want to solve is actually the three key tasks, namely, search, post and comparison. We want to improve the user experience on theses three key tasks to help them to finish the tasks better and wasier. Furthermore, we also have some additional problems which we want to tackle. Solving these problems may not help the user in finishing the key tasks. However, it produce other benefits like save the user time, etc. These problems can be generally categorized into 2 types, the overall user interface, the responsiveness of the whole system and also attachments.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Search</h5>
            <p>
                Previously, the search function is not obvious. User have to look around to find out the search bar. It is because the search bar is not in a outstanding position and the size of it is too small. 
                <br>
                <br>
                And the function of the search bar is quite confusing and not useful. For example, in the home page, it can only search the result within the same page. There is no a powerful global search, either. The user has to go into different faculty page to search the specific books. They cannot directly just use a global search to find out what they want. 
                <br>
                <br>
                At the same time, the search algorithm also has problems. The results after searching are listed randomly. Moreover, it is not clear whether the result is listed because its title contains the keyword or the description inside the post contains the keyword. It may make user confused if there is no keyword in the title but inside the post. They may think the search function give them a wrong result. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Post</h5>
            <p>
                The post page before has a lot of UI problems. Most of the users complain that there are too many useless buttons inside the post box, especially for audio attachment function. They have no idea why we need an audio attachment for selling or buying used textbooks. With so many buttons, the whole post looks very messy.
                <br>
                <br>
                The post box do not have a guideline on what need to be filled in, as well. It’s just a simple message box. There is no a standard way for the posting. So two posts may have a totally different layout, which may make the user feel confused and spend lots of time on finding the necessary information. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Comparison</h5>
            <p>
                In the old used textbook forum, no comparison functions are provided. It is because there is no a standard format on the input. So data like price is not stored on a comparable base. As a result, the difference between two posts are not intuitive. So it may become difficult for a user to decide from two different selling information. 
                <br>
                <br>
                hand, comparison should also allow users to select some interested posts and compare them. It is quite common that in current forum, there are many posts on the same book. However, users may be on interested in some of them. So if a system allows them to choose and display the interested posts,  it will be a great help
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Overall user interface</h5>
            <p>
                The whole design for the forum is not attractive. Everything inside the forum has an IVLE design style which is not that colorful and impressive. Especially, user2 mentioned that he may not want to use the old style forum if there is a newer and nicer one. And those important information has not been highlighted.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>The responsiveness of the whole system </h5>
            <p>
                In almost every interview, when we want to click on each faculty entry to search related textbooks, the loading time was very long. Furthermore, the time for search function to produce a result is very long. 
            </p>
            <!-- problem end -->
            <!-- solutions -->
            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <p>To solve the problems as mentioned above, we do a lot of user research and finally come out with some solutions.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Search</h5>
            <p>
                On the design part, the overall design of the search bar is very neat and clear. We put the search bar on top of the page and make the search bar as large as possible in order to make it be more outstanding. We also add some descriptions inside the search bar to show users what they can key in for searching. 
                <br>
                <br>
                On the function part, we implement powerful search function to the search bar by using angular js. The search function can not only support the global search but also can show the result very fast. Almost when you type in something, the results will change accordingly. To show the result more clearly, we list the search results by module code and post date to solve the previous problem “random listing”.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Post</h5>
            <p>
                To solve the UI problems, we decide to cut a lot of elements which remain in the current IVLE forum. For example, we cut the audio attachment, a lot of buttons and also the post box. In order to guide the user to fill the information, we standardize the input field for every post. So after clicking on the “post” icon, they will be directed to a new page. The necessary information will be listed clearly inside the page. What users need to do is just to fill in the according field, so that they do not need to worry about what information they need to write down. Based on this design, all posts will have same layout. We also implement the attachment function. But this time, we only allow the photo uploading to minimize the design elements.
                <br>
                <br>
                After user clicking on create post, a new post will be automatically generated. A preview page will be shown. The information will be listed out clearly. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Comparison</h5>
            <p>
                Based on our design, users can directly compare the items in the home page now. It is because we standardize the format for every post. Hence, in the home page, you can see those important information like price and book condition are listed within their own column. So it will be very convenient for users to compare different posts. 
                <br>
                <br>
                To make the comparison function more helpful, we also allow the users to select those interested posts. And there will be a button “show selected only” for them to toggle the visibility of unselected ones. As a result, users can directly compare those interested posts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>User interface</h5>
            <p>
                To solve the UI problems, we totally change the overall UI design. We try to design a modern and cool website to make it more attractive. So we use a popular “Flat Design” to make every element look flat. We also use black and white as main color to make it as neat as possible. Why we choose back and white is also because they are cool enough. We also add some nice effects to make the website different. For example, if you click on the hamburger icon on the top left, it will show a push effect to push the whole page to the right. 
                <br>
                <br>
                We also try to minimize our elements to make the whole website simple and neat. Everything you can see on the website is necessary or helpful. You will not find anything redundant. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>The responsiveness of the whole system</h5>
            <p>
                To solve the problem, as mentioned above, we use angular js for result listing. Aagular js allows fast data search and sorting. It has a lot of powerful functions associated with sorting, searching and filtering. By implementing the angular js functions, the result for search can be shown immediately.

            <br>

            <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <p>
            We basically conduct a formative evaluation on our final interactive prototype. We choose think aloud as our evaluation method. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We have invited totally three users to evaluate our final prototype. Each user will conduct the three key task we have described in G2, namely, search, post and compare. During the process conducting the three tasks, they need to speak out their thoughts/comments upon the final prototype they are interacting with. From the user’s experience, we can refine the statements he or she makes and list all the advantages and disadvantages of the prototype, which leads to our retrospective review and final prototype improvement. Besides, the user may also give us valuable suggestion as he or she is playing around the system. In order to capture all the useful points from the user, we have two members in charge of notes-taking, we also take audio recording of the user in case we miss some of the important points in our side notes. Finally, we will analyze the points we take down, summarize it, and know about where we are successful and where are not.

            <h4>
                Insights
            </h4>
            <br>
            <h5>Search</h5>
            <p>The search design is successful because we put it at the top of the page to highlight it. And we also add some description inside the search bar to tell the users what to type in. The function can run well because we implement it by using angular-js.</p>
            <br>
            <h5>Post</h5>
            <p>
                The post section is successful because we standardize the input fields and provide all the categories user may need. We also try to list them clearly. We also provide the checkbox for users to choose to show the specific condition information.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, the post section is not perfect. It is because some user may not understand how to rank the condition of a book. We do not provide this kind of guideline on the page. Also, some user complains that the create post button can not be found. It is because we do not put it at the bottom as usual while putting it on the top right. As a result, users may feel confused about it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Comparison</h5>
            <p>
                Similarly, there are some successful parts about the comparison section since we allow user to select his/her interested posts and toggle the visibility of the unselected ones. Moreover, our standardized format will help users to compare different posts directly.
                <br>
                <br>
                However, there is no way for differentiating those posts with the same “title, module code, price and condition” because we do not have special information for every post, like post date. Lacking of this information, those similar posts will be hard to be differentiated.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Overall User Interface</h5>
            <p>
                This part actually has the largest amount of problems. We can have some positive feedbacks because we mainly focus on providing a neat and clear UI. Hence, user have feedbacks like “very clear and neat.” And also we try to add some guidelines to help users understand the functions. 
                <br>
                <br>
                However, since we focus too much on the neat and clear UI, the overall design mat be too simple. As a result, there is no many decorations there. Hence, some users may think the overall UI is not so interesting. Another issue is the icons. The icons we choose is not so matched with our contents. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>Responsiveness of the Whole System</h5>
            <p>
                The overall responsiveness of the whole system is good now because we implement the functions in angular-js for searching and sorting.

                </a>
                Possible Adjustments
            </h3>
<pre>

1.  The first adjustment we want to make is to add some tips on 
    judging the condition. This is because some users may not know 
    how to rate the condition. 

2.  We also want to change the position or UI of the create post 
    button to make it more obvious.

3.  For differentiating two similar posts, we will take this into 
    consideration but we may not make adjustments on it. Because 
    we think add one more column like “post date” will make the 
    home page become messy.

4.  For the overall UI, we would like to add more colors to make 
    it look somewhat more colorful. But we will not add some 
    decorations on the page because we think it will make the 
    website become messy, as well.

5.  For the icon issue, we will try to choose some more appropriate 
    icons. This is because users have more direct feeling on the 
    design. Sometimes as designer, we may think the design is ok. 
    But for users, they may think it’s confused. I think the icon 
    issue here is an example.

                Interaction Design Process
            </h4>
            <p>
                From this course, one of the important thing we learn is the entire process to produce an interactive product. This process includes 7 stages.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first stage is to accept the situation and understand the problem. In this stage, we are required to be clear about what the problems we are going to discuss. The methods we learn here include interview, observation and questionnaire. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The second stage is analyzing the problem in order to deeply understand the problem and find out something that is not so obvious. This requires us to do some analysis from our interview or questionnaire data to extract some deeper ideas. In this stage, we learn method like affinity diagram.
                <br>
                <br>
                The third stage is to define the problems. This stage also includes defining the target user and key tasks to be solved. We learn how to design a target user and draw a story board for key task.
                <br>
                <br>
                The four stage is “ideate”. In this stage, we need to think of the possibilities and produce some different prototypes. What we do is developing some paper prototypes. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The fifth stage is to select the best option. We need to decide upon the best option by comparing the options on important parameters such as feasibility, risks etc. To make the decision, we can choose some target users to do an evaluation and finally summarize and analyze it. We also learn to draw a pros/cons table to clearly display the analysis result. 
                <br>
                <br>
                The sixth stage is to implement or to produce a final prototype. From this stage, we learn how to cooperate with each other to produce a single product.
                <br>
                <br>
                The final stage is to evaluate on our final product to make some improvements. In this stage, we find some users to do the evaluation again. And we analyze the result and do some adjustments accordingly.
                <br>
                <br>
                From this whole process, we can develop a whole interactive product effectively.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>
                User First
            </h4>
            <p>
                Since an interactive product will serve the user, so when we are doing the design, we should always think as a user. It requires designers not to design alone. Designers should have good communication with their target users to hear their feedback. Furthermore, when some parts of the product is produced, designers should also invite users to make evaluation. Only when doing like this, designers can produce a good interactive product.
