            <h6>Background</h6>
            <p>
            Jason is a year four computer science undergraduate in NUS. Since his study focus lies into a computer-related area, he interacts with computers every and is very familiar with the computer systems. He has been in NUS for seven semesters and has taken over thirty modules. Among those modules, over 70% requires one or more textbooks for the students to follow. Jason thus has accumulated a large bunch of textbooks of the modules he has taken. Hence, he decides to sell those used-textbooks instead throwing into into trash bins directly. He tried a few online used textbook trading platforms, but very few juniors contact him and ask about the textbooks.

            <h6>Background</h6>
            <p>
            Lucy has just joined NUS and she doesn’t know many seniors in the university. She is majored in Chinese Study in Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences and thus she is not very familiar with the computer systems. In the first lectures of the semester, she was told that she would need to buy the textbooks used in the module to catch up with the lecturer’s teaching progress. However, when she walked into bookstores and finally find the right book, she was shocked by the high price. As a result, she turns to seek a platform to buy the used-textbooks in good condition with much lower price. She has tried the textbook forum provided by the school. However, when she logged into the page, she was confused and didn’t know where to start. After several tries, she found the textbook which she wanted. However, after she left a message under the post, she never got replies. She guessed that the seller might have already sold the book or he/she never check the post again.

            <h5>Key tasks</h5>
            <h6>Searching for particular items</h6>
            <p>In order to display the information the users want to see, a powerful searching function is indispensable. User should be able to express their criteria and filter the results so that they can retrieve the desired content from the textbook forum.</p>
            <h6>Comparing among different items</h6>
            <p>After the user finished searching, the results should be clearly listed and the key attributes of the tasks should be placed appropriately so that the user can compare one of the item with each others, thus make decision on which one should he/she buy.</p>
            <h6>Posting buying/selling information</h6>
            <p>If the user failed to find the existing post that match his requirement, he or she can create a new post and leave the specific information of the textbook he or she wants to buy/sell. The user might need to get the notification in time if there is something happening related to his/her post so that the user could do further operation without long delay.</p>

            <h4>Major findings</h4>
            <h5>Search</h5>
<pre>

1. Search bar should be placed on top of the page. The search button will 
   contain a dropdown list, in which user can specify various search criteria.
   
2. User can select multiple search results, and toggle the visibility of 
   unselected ones.
   
</pre>

            <h5>Compare</h5>
<pre>

1. The column name should be clickable. Once clicked, the system will sort 
   the items according to the value of this column. Keep clicking will reverse 
   the order.
   
2. Smart sorting: ranks are calculated from price and condition.

3. Statistics: average, minimum, maximum price and total number of books (All
   figures are calculated based on current visible result).
   
4. When a seller is filling the book info, relative statistics will be shown. 
   (A background search is performed by the system, and the values shown is 
   calculated based on the search result)
   
</pre>

            <h5>Post</h5>
            <pre>
            
1. In some of our prototypes, the posts have been categorized into “selling 
   wishes” and “buying wishes”. However, base on the evaluation, most of the 
   users will ignore the “buying wishes” section. They tend to use the search 
   functionality to find what they want. Therefore, we decide to remain only 
   selling wishes section. However, in some special cases, the user may not 
   find what they want. In this case, we allow the user to add it to the his/
   her wish list. Later if some one post a qualified book on the forum, the 
   user will be notified (by email, etc.)

2. We find that we may include the following information:
    2.1 Book Specifics
        2.1.1 Module Code (*)
        2.1.2 Book Title (*)
        2.1.3 Author
        2.1.4 Edition
        2.1.5 Condition: Checklist & a figure from 1 to 10
        2.1.6 Photo: upload from desktop or smart phone
    2.2 Contact Specifics
        2.2.1 Phone (*)
        2.2.2 Email
    2.3 Order Specifics
        2.3.1 Price
        2.3.2 Remark
        
3. A preview will be shown for confirmation before the post is actually 
   recorded in the database.
            </pre>

            <h5>Account</h5>
            <p>
                (This is not mentioned in the three key tasks above, but we find that it is closely related to them during the user evaluation. Therefore we put it here as a major finding or a requirement for our G3 high-fidelity prototype.)
            </p>
<pre>

1. User can modified their contacts. (Which will be used to pre-fill 
   corresponding fields when they create a post)

2. User can view their historical posts, renew them or mark them with 
   “Sold out” or “Close”.

</pre>

            <h4>Summary & Reflection</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
            In G2, each of the team member has come up with an low-fidelity prototype. We evaluated each of the prototypes with 4 of our target users. In the process of evaluation, the author of the prototype helped the user to carry on with simulation while the rest of the team record the words and behaviors of the user. It’s a formative evaluation, we will improve our designs with the feedback of current prototypes from the potential users. 
            <br>
            <br>
            During the evaluation process, user will “think aloud” - to tell us how he/she is thinking or feeling and help us to understand more about the experience the system bring to him/her. The overall evaluation result is acceptable: we conclude the pros and cons from different prototype, list them in a form for easy comparison and we finally combine the good features from the 4 individual prototype to construct a single and integrate one.
            <br />
            <br />
            We are glad that we have always kept the two personas we came up with in Step One in our minds. The whole evaluation process is carried out with respects to the three main task from the two persona, namely searching, posting and comparing. We asked every testing user to proceed the three tasks and record their opinions. Nevertheless, we do not restrict them from side-lines: users can always give us whatever feedbacks or comments they want to give.
            <br />
            <br />
            However, there are problems occurring during the evaluation process. The most severe one is that the quality of prototypes is not good enough.  Only very basic low-fi paper prototypes are built to cover the main three task. Although this is the requirements specified inside the project manual and it might be good enough for us to burst some creative ideas, personally I think such low fidelity will bring in very much distraction when we are actually carrying out the evaluation. Most of the users cannot directly understand the meaning for the various components in the prototype. They tend to ask the designer to explain the interface. Without the explanation from the designer, it is very hard for users to find out how the system works. It is because low fidelity and incompleteness of the prototype do not allow them to do the trail & error explorations. However, if the designer explain how the system works, then it seems the purpose of evaluation is violated because during the actual use, designers cannot be aside to every user to guide them through the system. As this stage, personally we think doing an expert evaluation is more appropriate since we can explain the work flow of the system to experts and then they can evaluate the system with the heuristics and their own expertise. Such evaluation is much more insusceptible to the fidelity of prototype than those walkthrough evaluations involving actual users.
