    1. One key observation is the first problem our interviewee raised is always about UI. There are several UI problems which are mentioned by the interviewees with high frequency. For example, 3 of our interviewees said that there are too many useless buttons inside the post/reply box, especially for audio attachment function. They have no idea why we need an audio attachment for selling or buying used textbooks. With so many buttons, the whole post/reply box looks very messy. Almost all of our interviewees prefer a neat interface.
    <br>
    <br> Another issue is that the whole design for the forum is not attractive. Everything inside the forum has an IVLE design style which is not that colorful and impressive. Especially, user2 mentioned that he may not want to use the old style forum if there is a newer and nicer one.
    <br>
    <br> Last but not the least, UI design in the forum do not point out those information users are really interested in. For example, user4 would like to see the price and title information directly in the searching result lists. However, what she can see is only the module code and seller’s name. She have to click on the link and check the information inside. User2 and user4 also mentioned that there are only 10 posts per page, which is somewhat not enough. They want more results to be in one page.
    <br>
    <br> Some typical user statements about UI problems include:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>“The interface should be as neat as possible. The number of buttons should also be minimized.”</li>
        <li>“I don’t know the functionality of most buttons” </li>
        <li>“The UI is not attractive and not colorful. ”</li>
        <li>“Some information that provided by users are not that obvious ”</li>
    </ul>
    <br> Hence, to make a breakdown. UI problems can be generally divided into three categories. Firstly, there are some redundant functions and icons which makes the interface become very messy. Secondly, the interface does not provide sufficient information. For example, price is an important figure which is valued by users a lot, but it is not shown in the front page. Thirdly, the whole interface is not attractive and colorful.
    <br>
    <br> So from these three points, we can get some insights. What users want is a neat, nice platform. They do not want a lot of gaudy but useless functions. Using a software is an intuitive process, so users will mostly focus on what they see and what they can use. If there are many different kinds of functions or buttons, they may be lost since they are distracted by those unnecessary functions.
    <br>
    <br> Therefore, when designing a new used textbook platform, we should minimize our buttons and functions but at the same time provide significant information intuitively. The whole interface should look neat and nice, which requires us to do a lot of work on layout and graphic design.
    <br>
    <br> However, there are still questions like what information users are really care about. From our research, now we know price and textbooks title are something users care a lot. But what about other information? Are there any other information that users are greatly interested in? This may need further exploration since we do not do a lot of research on this area.
