<p>The features are ordered bases on the number of concerns they raised.</p>

<br>
<h5>User Interface</h5>
<p>Although we conduct interviews on only four target users, surprisingly there are twenty concerns (one fifth) are about the user interface. The word “nice”, “elegant” or “nice-looking” might be too general to conclude the exact design specifics. Therefore, we kept digging down this thread and found that users want the interface to contains the following detailed features: </p>
<h6>Clear</h6>
<p>The important informations should be clear to users. For example, the prices or titles should be placed carefully so that the user do not have to switch between pages frequently to check these information
</p>
<h6>Minimized</h6>
<p>
    only show the core functionalities and necessary details, e.g. show only on-sale items, only commonly used buttons, etc . </p>
<h6>intuitive</h6>
<h>icons of the buttons should be reasonable enough to induce what will happen if user click it. Less intuitive icons should be grouped with text that is strong enough to tell the functionalities.</h>
<h6>Consistent</h6>
<p>although it’s a new design, we still need to try to make it consistent to the existing systems. This will make it much easier for users to accept the new system.</p>
<h6>Self-Explaining</h6>
<p>since user will not bother to read a user guide before using the system, the system has to be self-explaining to some extent. For example, use placeholders to indicator the use of certain textfields, make reasonable titles for pages to help user navigate through the whole system.</p>

<br>
<h5>Standards for Information Format</h5>
<p>Among the 101 concerns, 10 are on the information format issues. These issues include user input standard and some unified standard about the book condition. Specifically,</p>
<h6>Templates for Users to use</h6>
<p>When user want to sell a text book, they should be some post skeletons for users to choose. What they need to do then is just fill in the important figures, such as price, condition, contact, etc. This helps users to recognize information they need to input instead of recalling, thus it lowers the chance that a user miss some important information. These templates should separate the information user input to different sections, each of which has its unique id. This will reserve the space for data manipulations later.</p>
<h6>A standard for book conditions</h6>
<p>Sometimes descriptions like 9/10, 8/10 do not give the buyers enough information to know about the exact condition of the book. A standard, which could be measured in figures, is need to act as the ruler of such descriptions.</p>

<br>
<h5>Responsiveness</h5>
<p>7 concerns are on the responsiveness of system. Users are not satisfied with the connections speed of the existing forum. Something that we need to do include</p>
<h6>Efficient Algorithms to Load Views</h6>
<p>This might be the main reason why current system operates so slow. We shall keep refine our algorithms to make the system scalable to large user groups.</p>
<h6>Deploy on Faster Servers</h6>
<p>This may be another factor that affects the performance of the website badly. We may want to deploy it on a faster server when it proves that the performance of current ones is the bottleneck of the system.</p>

<br>
<h5>Picture Attachments</h5>

<p>6 concerns are on attaching pictures to the post. User want a convenient way to upload and view images. Some requirements are:</p>

<h6>Easy Uploading</h6>
<p>A convenient way to upload pictures. Users need this functionality, but the super troublesome procedure of the currently system keeps them away from this. We need to brainstorm an idea to allow users to upload pictures easily with their smart phone.</p>
<h6>Easy Viewing</h6>
<p>Since we will support easy uploading, some posts may get many pictures attached inside. We need a organized way to display such pictures.</p>


<br>
<h5>Search</h5> Interestingly, only 4 concerns are about the searching functionality of the system, but all of our interviewees view searching as the most important functionality of a textbook forum. The requirements brought up by the users are:

<h6>Global Search</h6>
<p>There should be a way to search among all the books available on the forum. Although we will have different categories, yet we have to provide a second way in case some sellers put their books in the wrong section.</p>
<h6>Search for Various Attributes Other Than Title And Module</h6>
<p>Some users have the need to search for a specific version of a book while others may need to search for authors. We need to extend the current search engine to accept keywords in more domains.</p>
<h6>Specification of The Relationship between Keywords.</h6>
<p>Some users may need only one of the keywords they input is satisfied by the shown results while others may require the results met all the keywords. We need to provide a way for the user to specify which relationship they want. (AND-relationship or OR-relationship) </p>
