	Our user1 is a 25-year-old male student from computer science. We conducted the interview at COM1-DR1, during this 38-minutes-interview Mingyu and Yuxuan were the Interviewers while Fanshi and Jinghan were the note takers. This user raised a very good point that we havenâ€™t noticed before: when users click the button to insert an audio file, the forum will pop up a window to ask users to install a software called Silverlight. Our user thought the pop up window was very annoying and almost no one would actually choose to install the software. Besides, our user1 thought inserting an audio file is not really a useful feature. Based on this experience, we would like to cancel some seldom used features also avoid things like pop up window which may annoy the users. Last but not least, the server response was very slow during the interview, it took about 1 to 2 minutes to access a page. We think the server problem is also very serious.
