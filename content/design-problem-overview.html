	Design Problem Overview
</h3>

<p>At the beginning of each semester, almost every NUS student will encounter a problem: purchasing textbooks. However, based on our research, more than 72% of textbooks in Co-op cost more than 40 SGD. Some are even more than 60 SGD. The high prices lead to the birth of IVLE used-textbook market.</p>

<p>According to our research, there are generally three ways for NUS students to buy or sell their used textbooks. </p>
<p>1. 10%:  from friends/senior/juniors</p>
<p>2. 10%:  via Carousell</p>
<p>3. 80%:  via IVLE used-textbook forum</p>
<p>It is obvious that IVLE used textbook forum are the main platform for used textbooks exchanging. </p>

<p>However, based on our personal experiences and some complaint from classmates, our team find there are a lot of design problems with the forum. These problems include the confusing user interface design, defective functionalities, etc. These problems waste usersâ€™ time and bring in awful user experiences. Hence, our team would like to put our effort in the production of a new used textbook exchange platform. </p>
