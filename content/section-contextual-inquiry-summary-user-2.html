	Our user2 is a 21-year-old male student from computer science. We conducted the interview at COM1-DR1. During this 28-minutes-interview Fanshi and Jinghan were the Interviewers while Mingyu and Yuxuan were the note takers. Our user2 mentioned that there are some textbooks that are not used by any module, resulting in that he doesnâ€™t know how to search for it. Based on this point, we think the new forum needs to be able to search for not only the module code but also the name of the textbook.
