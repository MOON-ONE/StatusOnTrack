	The very first contextual inquiry is not as easy as we expected. We assigned two pals to be the interviewers and the rest two to be the note takers. This strategy has its own pros and cons. For the positive side, two interviewers created much more “run-time” ideas than only one: it is because for the same user behavior, two interviewers may have two completely different sets of questions, resulting in a wider inquiry coverage. However, some issues may occur on the coordination of the two interviewers. Sometimes, one interviewer may be interrupted by the other and thus the pace of the whole interview may go out of control. Maybe next time we’ll take a modified way: assign one teammate as the main interviewer, and assign another as “co-interviewer”. The co-interviewer will take notes of the questions he/she comes up during the interview and ask the interviewee when the main interviewer finishes his/her question sets. Or the co-interviewer will ask the interviewee in the end of the interview as complementary questions.<br><br>

	Most of the problems of the existing systems are revealed during the contextual inquiry and there are some wonderful ideas which we had never thought of before. Interestingly, such shining ideas are always from some subliminal words of the users instead of those formal answers. The viewpoints of our interviewees are greatly different with respect to their majors. The findings from the more professional interviewees (computer science students in this case) are usually the technical ones, such as the bugs or the poor performance of the system while other responses tend to be more general or intuitive.<br><br>

	The time periods the interview carried out introduces a lot of difficulties. Since it’s in the right middle of a semester, there are very few users using the used-text book forum. In other words, we had to ask the interviewees to pretend they are buying or selling their used textbooks. Although we created some posts on the existing forum in order to simulate a relative real situation, yet there is still a gulf between the contextual inquiry and actual cases. Another difficulty we met is the time length of the interview. Since everybody in NUS has a fast pace, it is not easy to ask a stranger to stall and accept a thirty-minute interview, even with rewards (We did prepare some rewards).<br><br>

	We did ask both general and specific questions. Some questions like “Does the interface bring troubles to you” will definitely gives very abstract answers. Although some specific questions may have better effects, yet we found that a demo is much more useful than a hundred questions. The demo will force the users to be concentrated. Furthermore, the demo process may reveal problems which interviewees usually ignore in every day life. Such problems are the ones that users usually are not aware of. However, they will appreciate it a lot if these problems are well solved. In other words, users are among the ones we value the most.<br><br>

	Of course, there are easy moments during the proceeding of such contextual inquiries. We enjoyed the process talking with end users. We were also surprised and excited at the ideas and new design options brought by them. The first step is taken and we are looking forward to the next.
