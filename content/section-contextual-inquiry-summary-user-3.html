	Our user3 is a 22-year-old male student from computer science. We conducted the interview at COM1-DR1. During this 32-minutes-interview, Jinghan and Mingyu were the Interviewers while Yuxuan and Fanshi were the note takers. The problem that user3 encountered during the interview is that he cannot quickly come up with what information to put in a post. He mentioned that users could easily forget to put some important informations such as their contact numbers. Therefore, our user3 suggested that we can provide some templates to help users post quickly. We think this is a very good idea.
